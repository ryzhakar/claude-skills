# orchestration

Agent delegation framework, multi-agent research orchestration, and development lifecycle coordination. Decompose work across model tiers, manage parallel swarms, govern quality, and orchestrate the plan-implement-review-fix loop.

## Skills

### [agentic-delegation](skills/agentic-delegation/SKILL.md)

The universal framework for decomposing work into agent-delegated units across model tiers.
Use this skill whenever work can be broken into parts — research, implementation, review,
debugging, testing, auditing, exploration, writing, or any combination.

Core thesis: cheap agents are essentially free. Decompose aggressively, delegate everything,
assemble the results. A swarm of micro-agents almost always beats a single capable agent.

Triggers: "delegate", "parallelize", "fan out", "use agents for", "use subagents",
"run in parallel", "dispatch", "orchestrate this"; or any task with clearly
independent subtasks where delegating preserves the orchestrator's context window.

### [dev-orchestration](skills/dev-orchestration/SKILL.md)

Extension of agentic-delegation for the software development lifecycle.
Adds the Plan→Implement→Review→Fix loop, dev-discipline agent orchestration,
TDD gates, status-driven branching, and debugging escalation.

Prerequisite: agentic-delegation (same plugin — must be read first).
Hard preference: dev-discipline plugin (implementer, spec-reviewer, code-quality-reviewer agents).

Triggers: "implement a feature end-to-end", "execute an implementation plan",
"build this with agents", "orchestrate development", "run the dev loop",
"implement using subagents", "dispatch implementers", "coordinate implementation and review".

### [research-tree](skills/research-tree/SKILL.md)

Govern multi-agent research across any knowledge surface: technology ecosystems, market landscapes,
academic fields, regulatory environments, curated indices, or any domain requiring breadth-first
exploration followed by depth-first verification.

Triggers: "research an ecosystem", "survey the landscape", "evaluate options for", "deep-dive",
"compare alternatives", "map out what exists", "find the best X for Y", "audit the market",
"what should I use for", "what's available in", "how does X compare to Y across the field".

The orchestrator governs agents that write durable reports to disk. It never does the research
itself. Its context window is for decisions, detection, and dispatch — not content.
